                      mentioning that your surname is Werry, elderly people in 
                      Kerkrade would ask: "From which Werrys? The Spekholzerheide 
                      Werrys?" (Spekholzerheide is a certain area of Kerkrade). 
                      <br>
                      Mostly they mean the Werrys from the "Pleinstraat" (straat=street), 
                      because those people ran a bakery in the past. Or they mean 
                      the Werrys from the "Drievogelstraat", for they used to 
                      be auto mechanics. <br>
                      As they all were tradespeople from Spekholzerheide, they 
                      were well known. Sorry to say, but we are not descendants 
                      of those Werrys and so we are not well known. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#006666" size="2">Although 
                      we would appreciate people spelling our surname correctly 
                      (Werrij in our case), this name is probably written in the 
                      English linguistic area only one way: as Werry. The reason 
                      why the name Werry in the Netherlands is written in so many 
                      different ways is because in the past, it simply depended 
                      on the person who wrote it down (a priest or later a registrar 
                      of births, marriages and deaths). Most people could not 
                      write themselves, so the clerk wrote down what he thought 
                      he heard. <br>
                      If you want to be sure about the correct spelling of your 
                      ancestors surname, you'll have to consult our family tree 
                      later. </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#006666" size="2">All 
                      the Werrys that we found in our search can simply be subdivided 
                      into two, or actually three main branches: </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#006666" size="2">Our 
                      common ancestor <b>Claes Werry</b>, had two sons, who had 
                      children themselves: <br>
                      </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#006666" size="2">the 
                      oldest son - <b>Petrus Aegidius</b> - lived at Spekholzerheide 
                      and he is the one who could be held responsible for the 
                      existence of all the Werrys from Kerkrade; <br>
                      the second son - <b>Michael</b> - moved and settled down 
                      at Simpelveld, a small village approximately 4 kilometres 
                      from Spekholzerheide. He also had children, but that line 
                      probably became extinct. We are still investigating about 
                      that… </font></p>
                    <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#006666" size="2">Petrus 
                      Aegidius had several sons and unfortunately some of them 
                      could not be tracked. They possibly moved to the German 
                      area. At the moment, the surname Werry happens to be rather 
                      current in the border area of Kerkrade (Aachen / Herzogenrath 
                      and environment). We have not yet been able to investigate 
                      about them, as it is not easy for an amateur genealogist 
                      to get access to German archives, because of the "Datenschutz" 
                      (legislation concerning the protection of someone's privacy). 
                      So, we are asking our German namesakes to provide us with 
                      dates and other information that could be of use in our 
                      search. </font></p>

                      the most important sons in our family tree are: <br>
                      <b>Laurentius</b> (born 1759) and <b>Joannes Nicolaus</b> 
                      (born 1774). </font></p>

                      descendants of Joannes Nicolaus can again be subdivided

                      </b><br>
                      Firstly, the descendants of <b>Jean Mathieu</b> (born 1807): 
                      <br>
                      He had six sons, but only one of them - the youngest one 
                      - stayed at Kerkrade. About the others we know that some 
                      of them left for the German area. The rest could not be 
                      tracked. <br>
                      From the youngest son, <b>Kaspar Lodewijk</b> (born 1849) 
                      - also mentioned as the line <b>Werry-Hoffmans</b> - descended 
                      the Werrys from the Drievogelstraat (the<b> Werry-Knubben</b> 
                      family), just like the Werrys who moved to Liege (Belgium) 
                      and Lourdes (France). </font></p>

                      Secondly, the four sons of<b> Peter Joseph</b> (born 1815)): 
                      they all were shoemakers by profession and they settled 
                      down at the respective places of Kerkrade (the <b>Werry-Hinskens</b> 
                      and the <b>Werry-Rosenbom</b> families), Herzogenrath (the
